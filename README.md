   Insurance Analytics: Insurance Risk Insights Dashboard


2.Description/Purpose

   The Insurance Risk Insights Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze key aspects of the insurance domain — including claims, customer       risk, policy performance, fraud detection, and financial trends. It helps identify high-risk areas, optimize policy decisions, and improve overall business         performance through data-driven insights.


3.Tech Stack

    The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

   - Power BI Desktop Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
   - Power Query Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
   - DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
   - Data Modeling Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
   - File Format .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

     . Business Requairement

     An insurance company is looking to better understand its policyholder base and claim patterns to make data-driven business decisions. Currently, policy and         claims data are scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult for stakeholders to track performance and identify trends.
     The company requires a centralized interactive dashboard in Power BI that can provide a clear overview of:


    . Walk through of Key visuals

     1.	By Car Use (Donut Chart) – To analyse policy distribution and claim amounts based on how cars are being used (e.g., personal, commercial).
     2.	By Car Make (Bar Chart) – To identify which car brands have higher policies and claims, highlighting brand-based risks.
     3.	By Coverage Zone (Donut Chart) – To evaluate policies and claims by geographic zones, useful for regional risk analysis.
     4.	By Age Group (Frequency Chart/Histogram) – To assess policyholders’ age distribution and identify which age brackets file more claims.
     5.	By Car Year (Area Chart) – To analyse how the car’s age (year of manufacture) impacts policy counts and claim amounts.
     6.	By Kids Driving (Ribbon Chart) – To compare the impact of young drivers in households on policy count and claim amounts.
     7.	By Education (Pie Chart) – To understand how education levels correlate with insurance policy adoption and claims.
     8.	By Education & Marital Status (Matrix Heat Grid) – To explore the combined effect of education and marital status on policies and claims, highlighting              customer profiles.
